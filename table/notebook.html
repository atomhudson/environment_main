<h4>How to recycle spiral notebooks</h4>

<p>Though many ask, “can you recycle notebooks?” the answer is most definitely, “Yes!” Recycling journals and notebooks can be relatively simple when you understand the various components.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Metal and plastic coils:</b> Some advanced recycling systems will allow you to throw the paper and metal or plastic binding portion of a notebook into the blue bin still bound together. The metal will be separated from the paper during the recycling process. Just be sure to find out one way or another before assuming it’s okay to not disassemble your notebooks. If you do need to remove them, see our tips below for how to recycle notebook coils.</li>

    <li><b>PLastic covers:</b> These should always be removed from notebooks for recycling as they will contaminate a batch of paper recycling. Sometimes this portion of the plastic can be recycled separately, but you should ask your recycling personnel to be sure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to remove the coil from a spiral-bound notebook</h4>

<p>Whether your notebooks are bound together with a plastic or metal coil, you should remove this portion of the notebook before recycling the paper and the cover. Here are two methods for removing a notebook’s coil you can try:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Unwind:</b> Start by securing the notebook on a counter or table with the coil hanging over the edge. Weigh it down with a heavy object and then find the crimped parts (at each end) of the coil. Snip off both crimped portions and then start to pull the coil out of the holes. It should unspiral until the whole thing comes free.</li>
    <li><b>Pull: </b> Many types of plastic coils have separate “rings” for each hole in your journal or notebook. That means removing it can be as easy as pulling the coil from the bound-side of your journal. The pages should all be separate and ready to recycle.</li>
</ul>

<P>Once your coil is free, here are some suggestions for how to reuse the coil:</P>
<UL>
    <li>Cut the coil to a few inches, then bending it at one end to make Christmas ornament hangers</li>
    <li>Twist the wire so that it turns into a dipper for decorating Easter eggs</li>
    <li>Use it as the wire for hanging pictures</li>
</UL>

<p>If you can’t reuse your notebook coil, you may be able to recycle it. If your coil is metal, it should be recyclable with your other metal materials. Plastic coils can often also be recycled depending on the type of plastic used. Check with your local recycling facilities to ensure whether this is acceptable in your curbside bin.</p>
