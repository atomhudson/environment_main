    <p>They’re a stinky, dirty problem, but someone has to deal with them, and the landfill certainly isn’t going to do the work. We’re talking dirty diapers, of course, and we’re on a mission to find eco-friendly baby diaper disposal methods for wannabe green parents. Along the way, we hope to find methods for recycling things like feminine hygiene and incontinence products like pads and tampons, too, since they’re all considered absorbent sanitary products. Come with us to learn more.</p>

    <h4>Why recycle diapers and feminie products?</h4>

    <p>The environmental hazards of disposable tampons and pads, incontinence, and diaper products are pretty big, but the eco-gains we achieve by recycling this type of waste are great:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>  Significant savings: </b>
          Recycling sanitary products saves water, trees, natural gas, and landfill volume. Used hygiene products can also be turned into new materials for more sustainable use.
        </li>

        <li>
           <b> Biodegradability: </b>
           Sanitary pads can take 500 to 800 years to decompose in a landfill, and add untreated sewage to the mix in the meantime, which can contaminate groundwater and soil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Waste & emissions problem:</b> The average baby will use between 5,000 and 6,000 diapers in their lifetime, and the estimated carbon dioxide emissions from pads and tampons are 12,800 tons per year.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <br>
<p>Companies such as Knowaste have been working on technologies that take the contents of dirty diapers and other absorbent sanitary products and separate them to turn them into new products. Generally, the process looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The materials are sanitized</li>
    <li>The plastic and the wood pulp are separated mechanically</li>
    <li>The wood pulp is used to make things like shoe insoles, oil filters, recycling paper products, absorption materials, and wallpaper</li>
    <li>The plastic goes on to be made into plastic wood, vinyl siding, and roof shingles</li>
</ul>
<p>The same types of methods could likely be used to recycle things like sanitary products for women and the incontinent, though no formal programs are yet in the works.</p>
