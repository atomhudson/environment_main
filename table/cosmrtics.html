    <p>If you’re cleaning out your makeup drawer to make room for only organic lipsticks and eco-friendly eye shadows, you may find yourself in need of some cosmetic recycling solutions for disposing of your old makeup. While it can be a challenge to recycle makeup and the containers it comes in, it just got easier with our guide to recycling cosmetics.</p>

    <h4>Preventing cosmetic toxins and waste from entering the environment</h4>
    <p>Why is it important to recycle your makeup packaging and leftover cosmetic products? Here are some good eco-reasons for eco-friendly disposal methods:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Volume of garbage:</b> The average American woman uses 12 beauty products every day, and with more than 160 million women, that’s a lot of packaging waste.</li>
        <li><b>Toxic pollution:</b> Disposal of consumer products, including things like medicines, personal care products, and makeup, is now the primary cause for contamination of fresh and ocean waters in industrialized nations, especially since water treatment plants are unable to break down the majority of the toxins that we put into them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are many types of packaging used to wrap up our cosmetics and makeup, including the following:</p>
    <ul><li>Cardboard and paper boxes</li>
    <li>Disposables like puffs, sponges, spatulas, tweezers, curlers, sharpeners, and swabs</li>
<li>Fabric makeup cases</li>
<li>Glass and mirror</li>
<li>Plastic of various numbers</li>
<li>Shopping bags</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commonly used cosmetic packages, like cardboard boxes, can be easily recycled with other packaging materials, though many makeup containers are made from less common recyclable plastics (plastics #1 and #2 are the easiest to recycle). Unfortunately, due to the fact that many types of plastics aren’t labeled with a resin number, community recycling programs will often refuse things like cosmetic compacts and lipstick cases.</p><br>

<h4>Reducing your cosmetic packaging waste</h4>
<p>As always, the simplest way to lower your cosmetic packaging waste impact is to choose better packaging before you bring your makeup home from the drug store or the makeup shop. Look for these eco-friendly packaging characteristics to make more sustainable cosmetic choices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Biodegradable</li>
    <li>No shopping bags (take your own reusable shopping bag!)</li>
    <li>Buy only what you need (don’t stock up on cosmetics you can’t consume before they expire)</li>
    <li>Choose refillable makeup containers that you can add different colors to as your style changes</li>
    <li>Take care of your brushes and makeup applicators by cleaning them so that they last a long time</li>
</ul>
