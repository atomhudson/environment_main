<p>Pretty blue glass bottles and fun green glass bottles add interest to our experience of glass, but recycling colored glass with clear glass can be an economic hazard. That’s because mixing different colors of glass in the recycling process can diminish the quality of recycled glass. Find out why separating colored glass from clear glass is important and how to go about doing it.</p>

<h4>Differences between various colors of glass</h4>
<p>Though the basic glass recipe is similar across all types of glass, various types of glass are made with additional ingredients to impart various qualities, such as color, reflectivity, and so on. But because of these variable ingredients, certain types of glass have to be recycled separately from conventional glass. Colored glass is one such type of glass that requires special handling. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Recycling blue glass:</b> Made with naturally-occurring iron impurities in sand, blue glass is used for food and beverage containers as well as glass for home design (tiles, flooring, stained glass, etc).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Recycling brown glass:</b> The brown color found in this glass type is a result of things like carbon, nickel, and sulphur which is added to molten glass. Brown glass is used to make many food containers to protect what’s inside from direct exposure to sunlight. This preserves flavor and freshness, so is often used for things like beer and food that would easily oxidize in the presence of sunlight.
    </li>
    <li><b>Recycling green glass:</b> Like brown glass, green glass is created by adding ingredients to the molten glass, including copper, iron, and chromium. It also protects its contents from exposure to sunlight and extremes of temperature and so green glass is often used for food and drink preservation.
         </li>
</ul>

<h4>Things you should not include with your clear glass recycling</h4>
<p>Though there are many types of glass that can be recycled – both colored and clear – some glass types cannot be recycled with your regular curbside glass recycling. </p>
<p>When “contaminants” are mixed in with glass to be recycled, it can decrease the value of the recovered glass, increase costs, slow production, reduce quality, and damage recycling equipment. As a result, you should not only remove metal and plastic lids and neck rings from your glass containers, but also be sure to keep the following types of glass out of your regular recycling bin:</p>

<ul><li>
    Ceramic dishes and coffee cups 
</li>
<li>Drinking glasses, including crystal and opaque glasses</li>
<li>Light bulbs (incandescent and compact fluorescents)</li>
<li>Heat resistant glass cookware such as Pyrex or Visionware</li></ul>
