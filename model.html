<h4>Recycle the rest of the plastic.</h4>
<p>After your PET plastic is dealt with, it’s time to focus on the other plastics you collected. If you sorted your plastics properly in the previous steps, you should have a pile of recyclable plastics by now, and all that’s left is to take them to the closest recycling center, and you’re done!</p>
