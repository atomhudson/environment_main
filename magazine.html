<h4>How glossy paper is made and recycled</h4>

<p>The glossy paper used to make magazines and catalogs is created by coating it with a white clay called kaolin and buffing it with rollers. This process makes it easier to print high-color images and pictures and gives you that squeaky, shiny look and feel you love</p>
<p>On the flip side, once collected and transported to a recycling center, magazines and catalogs are shredded and mixed up with water to create pulp. Then, like the regular paper making process, the pulp is washed and cleaned, refined, and blended into a slushy mess. When magazines and catalogs are recycled, the resulting fibers are not as strong as they once were, so they’re used to make facial tissue, paperboard, newspaper, and writing paper, but they cannot be remade into new magazines.</p>

<p>Whether you’re addicted to flipping through glossy catalogs or reading the latest Hollywood rag, if you’re a greenie, you’ve likely already considered your printed reading habit’s impact on the environment. That’s a good thing, because producing magazines and catalogs requires a lot of resources and produces a lot of waste:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Approximately 9 billion catalogs are sent out to Americans every year, which results in millions of tons of carbon dioxide being emitted.</li>
    <li>Though recycling rates for paper in the US are relatively high, the magazine recycling rate is only about 20%.</li>
    <li>Printing a million copies of a magazine requires 348,000 pounds of paper. Some magazines, such as AARP in the USA, print tens of millions of copies per issue.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to recycle your used magazines</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Clean them up:</b> You’ll need to remove contaminants like membership cards, product samples, stickers, plastic wrap, windows, and other fun add-ons included with your magazines or catalogs.</li>
    <li><b>Curbside recycle:</b> If you have a pick-up program for your weekly recycling, usually you can include glossy materials like magazines and catalogs, though you should check your program rules to be sure.</li>
    <li><b>Drop-off recycle:</b> When curbside recycling isn’t available, if there are drop-off recycling programs in your community, as to whether they will take your used magazines and catalogs.</li>
</ol>
